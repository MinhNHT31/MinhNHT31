ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Thai Minh, a Computer Science student immersed in the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence.

âœ¨ I thrive on the challenge of tackling projects that harness the power of Deep Learning and real-time object detection.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m exploring a variety of AI domains, including:

#Computer Vision:
-Mastering CNN architectures like ResNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet
-Delving into cutting-edge YOLO models (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10)
-Utilizing U-Net and GANs
-Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers to enhance win rates in trading
#The thrill of learning and collaborating on impactful projects drives my passion every day.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect! Together, we can bring innovative AI ideas to life and explore the endless possibilities that await us in this dynamic field!
