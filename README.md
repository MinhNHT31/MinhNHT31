-ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Thai Minh, a CS student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. 

-âœ¨I love working on projects that involve Deep Learning and real-time object detection, and I'm particularly interested in applying AI to fields like sports analytics and emotion recognition.

-ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm exploring video summarization, YOLO-based face detection, and object tracking. I'm always excited to learn more and collaborate on impactful AI projects.
