ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Thai Minh, a passionate Computer Science student diving deep into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence.

âœ¨ I thrive on the challenge of tackling projects that harness the power of Deep Learning and real-time object detection.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm on an exciting journey exploring the realms of Computer Vision. From mastering CNN architectures like ResNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet to delving into cutting-edge YOLO models (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10), as well as U-Net and GANs, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. The thrill of learning and collaborating on groundbreaking projects fuels my passion every day.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect! Together, we can bring innovative AI ideas to life and explore the endless possibilities that await us in this dynamic field!
